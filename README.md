# spawnit

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tjdavenport/spawnit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tjdavenport/spawnit)

Spawnit allows you to start prototyping your Javascript browser application with zero boilerplate. It will start a configurable,
customizeable expressjs development server that supports live reloading, live css injection, SASS transpilation, bundling 
with Browserify, and script concatenation. No boilerplate is needed to start creating elaborate single page applications.
